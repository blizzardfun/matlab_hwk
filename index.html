        <h3> Pharmaceutical homework problem using data from csv files read into Pandas dataframes 
            with results of analysis plotted using Matplotlib.</h3>

            <p>After reading the csv data files, the data on each mouse and on clinical measurements of 
                response to drug treatment,
                 the average tumor volume measurements were grouped by drug and days treatment. 
                 The standard error of the mean was calculated followed by reformatting and then
                graphing of the results including error bars for each data point.

                <p>Using the merged data, the measurements of the average number of metastatic sites 
                    were grouped by drug and days treatment.

            <p>Using the count of surviving mice in the study the count was grouped by drug and days 
                treatment. It was then 
                reformatted and the counts were graphed for each drug and the days treatment.</p>

            <p> The percentage change in tumor volume for the entire study for each drug was calculated and grouped 
                into passing for a decrease in tumor size and failing for increased tumor size. The percentage change in tumor size 
            for each drug is shown on a bar graph with the percentage value printed on the bar for ease of 
            comparison</p>
