Pymaceutical homework problem using pandas dataframes and matplotlib  for plotting graphs

Using csv files which contain mouse test data for each mouse in the study and clinical data regarding the response to treatment, the following 4 graphs will be produced

Tumor Response to Treatment - plots the mean tumor volume with the Standard Error of the Mean(SEM) over time for each drug in the clinical study

Metastatic Response to Treatment- plots the number of metastatic sites with the SEM over time for each drug in the study

Survival Rate During Treatment - plots the survival rate of the mice in the study for each drug in the study.

Tumor Change Over 45 Days Treatment - bar graph to compare the overall tumor volume change for each drug in the study with colors to indicate growth or reduction in size.

These graphs show that only two of the  drugs are successful in producing positive outcomes. 

One function autolabel is defined and located in the  graph.py file
Another function for data munging minor_mung is defined and located within the Jupyter Notebook file
